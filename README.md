#Constraints:

At least 41 of the games played by each team must be home games
Teams cannot play 3 consecutive games and shouldn't play more than 3 games in 5 days
No scheduling on holidays (Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving)
Teams canâ€™t be on the road longer than 2 weeks 
There need to be enough rest days between travel
